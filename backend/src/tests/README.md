Authcontroller.test
Mocking: Each test uses jest.mock to mock the database interactions and other external dependencies like bcrypt and jsonwebtoken.

Request and Response Mocking: The mockRequest and mockResponse functions are used to create mock request and response objects for the tests, simulating the behavior of Express.js.

Test Cases: Each method in the controllers has corresponding test cases to check:

Successful operations (e.g., successful registration, login, project creation).
Handling of errors (e.g., user already exists, project not found).
Middleware functionality (e.g., verifying tokens and checking admin roles).
Assertions: The tests include assertions to ensure that the expected response status and JSON output match the actual output from the controller methods.

Auth middleware Test
Each test checks specific scenarios, such as:
No Token Provided: Verifies that the middleware responds with a 401 status and an appropriate message when no token is present.
Invalid Token: Tests that the middleware responds with a 401 status when an invalid token is provided.
Valid Token: Checks that the middleware correctly decodes a valid token, attaches the user payload to the request, and calls the next() function.

AuthRoutes Test:

Tests the user registration and login processes by simulating HTTP requests to the /api/auth endpoint.
Verifies that the registration endpoint responds correctly when valid data is sent and returns a token.
Checks for proper error handling when invalid data is submitted, ensuring that the response includes error messages.


ProjectRoutes Test:

Tests creating and updating projects via the /api/project endpoint.
Simulates authentication by mocking the authMiddleware, ensuring that the user is authenticated during the requests.
Checks that the expected project data is returned in the response.


TeamController.test.ts
These are unit tests that that focus on testing two key functions (createTeam and updateTeam) from the TeamController. These tests check the behavior of the functions under various scenarios using mocking to isolate the logic from external dependencies (such as the database).jest.mock("../xata"): This mocks the getXataClient to prevent actual database operations.
jest.spyOn(xata.db.Team, "create") and jest.spyOn(xata.db.Team, "update"): These are used to spy on and mock the behavior of the create and update methods, allowing you to simulate various scenarios (like successful creation, update, or error cases).
Mock Request and Response:

The tests use mockRequest and mockResponse helper functions to simulate Express.js Request and Response objects. This allows you to test the controller methods in isolation without needing an actual HTTP server.
Breakdown of the Tests:
Test for createTeam:

This test simulates a request to create a new team.
It mocks the xata.db.Team.create method to return a successful team creation response.
It verifies that the response status is 201 (Created) and that the correct JSON response is returned.
Tests for updateTeam:

Successful Update:
Mocks the request to update a team's name.
Uses jest.spyOn to simulate the behavior of xata.db.Team.update returning a successful update.
It checks if the json method is called with the updated team data.
Team Not Found:
Simulates a case where the teamId does not exist.
Mocks xata.db.Team.update to return null, indicating that the team was not found.
It checks if the response status is 404 (Not Found) and the correct error message is returned.
